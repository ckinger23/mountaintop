## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
go mod download
go run cmd/api/main.go

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

See `QUICKSTART.md` for full details including database setup.

### Option 2: Read First
1. Start with `README.md` for comprehensive overview
2. Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand system design
3. Follow `QUICKSTART.md` to get it running
4. Use `API_EXAMPLES.md` to test endpoints

## 🎓 Learning Go Through This Project

This is a great Go learning project because it covers:

### Go Basics
- ✅ Package structure and organization
- ✅ Struct definitions and methods
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Pointer usage

### Web Development
- ✅ HTTP routing with Chi
- ✅ Middleware patterns
- ✅ Request/response handling
- ✅ JSON encoding/decoding
- ✅ CORS configuration

### Database
- ✅ GORM ORM usage
- ✅ Model definitions
- ✅ Relationships (foreign keys)
- ✅ Migrations
- ✅ Queries and filters

### Security
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ JWT token generation
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Authorization (admin checks)

### Best Practices
- ✅ Separation of concerns (handlers, models, middleware)
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Dependency injection
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Code organization

## 💡 What Makes This Different

### Compared to Your Current Dashboard:
1. **Persistent Storage**: Database instead of hardcoded data
2. **User Management**: Multiple users with authentication
3. **Admin Controls**: Admins can manage games/results
4. **Scalability**: RESTful API can support mobile apps, etc.
5. **Real-time Updates**: Picks update automatically when games finish

### Production-Ready Features:
- JWT authentication with proper security
- Input validation and error handling
- CORS configured for frontend
- Soft deletes (data not lost)
- Relationship management (foreign keys)
- Admin authorization checks

## 🔧 Next Steps & Enhancements

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Get it running locally
2. Create admin user and test flow
3. Add a few more teams/games
4. Invite a friend to test

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Build admin UI for creating seasons/weeks/games
2. Add email notifications for pick deadlines
3. Improve mobile responsive design
4. Add user profile pages with stats

### Medium-term (Season 1)
1. Integrate ESPN API for automatic game data
2. Add confidence pools (rank picks)
3. Create weekly recap emails
4. Add social features (comments, trash talk)

### Long-term
1. Deploy to production (AWS/Heroku)
2. Build mobile app (React Native)
3. Add payment processing (for money pools)
4. Historical data analysis and charts

## 🛠️ Technology Choices Explained

### Why Go?
- Fast and efficient
- Great for APIs and web services
- Compiles to single binary (easy deployment)
- Excellent standard library
- Growing in popularity (good career skill)

### Why React?
- Industry standard for modern web apps
- Great ecosystem and community
- Reusable components
- You're already familiar with it

### Why SQLite → PostgreSQL?
- SQLite: Perfect for development (no setup)
- PostgreSQL: Production-ready, scalable
- Easy migration path between them

### Why Chi Router?
- Lightweight and fast
- Idiomatic Go (feels like net/http)
- Great middleware support
- Better than Gin/Echo for learning

### Why GORM?
- Most popular Go ORM
- Easy to learn
- Handles migrations
- Works with multiple databases

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

```
Users ──┐
        │
        ├──> Picks ──> Games ──> Weeks ──> Seasons
        │              │
        │              └──> Teams
        │
        └──> (calculated) Leaderboard
```

## 🎮 User Flow

1. **Register** → Create account
2. **Login** → Receive JWT token
3. **View Games** → See current week's matchups
4. **Make Picks** → Select winners before games start
5. **Wait** → Games happen
6. **Admin Enters Results** → Scores recorded
7. **View Leaderboard** → See updated standings
8. **Repeat** → Next week!

## 📱 Pages Breakdown

### Login Page (`Login.tsx`)
- Email/password form
- JWT token storage
- Redirect to picks after login

### Make Picks (`MakePicks.tsx`)
- Current week's games
- Team selection interface
- Lock time enforcement
- Save picks individually

### Leaderboard (`Leaderboard.tsx`)
- Standings table
- Points, record, win %
- Visual ranking (🥇🥈🥉)

### Admin Panel (`Admin.tsx`)
- Game result entry
- Score inputs
- "Mark as Final" checkbox
- Triggers automatic scoring

## 🔐 Security Features

- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT tokens (24hr expiration)
- Protected routes (authentication required)
- Admin-only endpoints
- Pick lock time enforcement
- Input validation

## 📈 Performance Considerations

Current setup handles:
- **Users**: 100s
- **Concurrent picks**: Plenty
- **Games/season**: Unlimited

To scale to 1000s of users:
- Switch to PostgreSQL
- Add Redis for caching
- Use connection pooling
- Add rate limiting

## 🤝 Contributing & Customization

Feel free to:
- Add new features
- Change styling (it's Tailwind!)
- Add more stats/charts
- Integrate external APIs
- Build mobile version
